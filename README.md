# MontyHall Problem simulation!
The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after the show's original host, Monty Hall.

## Problem:
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

## Task:
Create a program which verifies and reports to the user that in the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) it is statistically beneficial for you to switch doors.
